## This is the Obsidian Plugin for Sekund.io

Here’s what you have to do.

under settings, go to “Community plugins” and look for the little folder icon:

     style="width: 350px"/>

This should open the plugins folder for the vault you have currently open.
Now please download the Sekund plugin from [this location](https://sekund.s3.amazonaws.com/sekund-obsidian-plugin.zip)

Unzipping it will result in a folder called `sekund-obsidian-plugin` with 3 files in it (manifest.json, main.js and styles.css). Drop this folder in your vault’s plugin folder.

**now, for testing, please join the 'app' team at [https://app.sekund.io](https://app.sekund.io)**

**If you want your own team, please contact this plugin's author**

Once your account is created, please copy your API key to the clipboard, like so:

Finally, type "Sekund" at the Obsidian's command prompt, and choose one of the four options:

You will be invited to enter your subdomain and API key.

Once logged in, please explore the four different tabs available in Sekund: Home, Peoples, Groups and Chat.

## Home

The home view will simply display all the notes that you have uploaded to Sekund and possibly shared with either peoples or groups. If there are comments, the number of comments is also shown.

## Chat
